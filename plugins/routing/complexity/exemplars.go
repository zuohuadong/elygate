package complexity

// Default semantic-routing exemplars are balanced along two axes at once.
//
// Use case: each tier contains 14 coding, 6 math/data, 6 writing, 5 knowledge,
// 5 conversational/creative, 5 extraction/classification, 3 pasted-material,
// 3 translation, and 3 agentic prompts. Topic ladders place related vocabulary
// in every tier so nearest-neighbor classification learns requested work rather
// than subject matter.
//
// Surface form: cosine similarity is at least as sensitive to how a request is
// written as to what it asks for, so form is balanced deliberately instead of
// being left to follow difficulty. Exemplars stay short and prototypical -- a
// long, hyper-specific phrase embeds mostly as its own incidental content and
// matches only near-identical requests, and a tier whose members are uniformly
// longer than the tier below it teaches the classifier that verbosity means
// difficulty. Tier length ranges therefore overlap on purpose: what separates
// them is the requested work, not the word count.
//
// The same applies to every other surface feature. Question and imperative
// phrasing, capitalized and all-lowercase text, terse and fully specified
// requests, and prompts that embed code all appear in similar proportion in all
// three tiers. Any of them concentrated in one tier becomes a shortcut the
// classifier will take: a tier that is mostly questions routes every question
// to itself. exemplars_test.go asserts the spread; keep it when editing.
//
// Every exemplar's tier must be derivable from its own text. Pointing at
// content that arrives with the request is fine ("summarize these notes"), but
// a phrase whose work lives in an earlier turn ("yes, go with option 2") has no
// defensible tier: option 2 could be a rename or a migration. Labelling one
// SIMPLE teaches the classifier to route every contentless follow-up to the
// cheapest model, whatever the conversation was actually about.
