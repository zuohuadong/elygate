// LimitHolderKind identifies what kind of entity a limit hangs off. These are the values a
// schemas.Limit carries in HolderKind. An open string, like PermitType, so a deployment resolving a
// holder of its own can name it without this package changing. The kinds that do exist are named
// below rather than wherever each is resolved, because telling one limit from another is a single
// vocabulary and a reader should not have to know which layer introduced a kind.
type LimitHolderKind string

// Every kind of limit holder, declared together and grouped by holder. Within a holder the kinds
// run from the widest scope to the narrowest: the holder's own limits, spent by every request it
// makes; its per-provider limits, spent only by requests that provider serves; and its per-model
// limits, spent only by requests for that model.
//
// Once resolved for an attempt, a request's limits are one flat list, and these are what tell them
// apart afterwards: a refusal has to say whether it was your key's budget or your team's, and a
// caller looking at several limits of the same shape needs to know which is which.
//
// Nothing registers or enumerates them. Enforcement covers every kind, so a limit carrying any of
// these is checked and charged by the same path, and a deployment that resolves a holder of its own
// declares its kind here and is enforced by construction.
