// This file implements runtime resilience for the materialized-view read
// path. Startup already repairs shape drift (repairMatViewShapes diffs the
// live catalog against matviewRequiredColumns and drops stale views), but a
// query can still hit a missing or stale-shaped view at runtime: a replica
// that lost the ensureMatViews advisory-lock race during a rolling deploy
// reads while the lock holder is mid-rebuild, or an operator drops a view.
// Rather than gating reads on catalog checks (the approach of 8354ca76,
// reverted in 9c3e4c7f3), the failing query itself signals staleness: the
// dispatch site serves that request from the raw logs table, the matview
// read path is disabled process-wide, and a single-flight background repair
// recreates and refreshes the views before re-enabling it. A premature
// ready=true from any source is therefore harmless - the next shape error
// restarts the cycle, and the system converges once shapes are current.

// isMatViewShapeError reports whether err indicates a materialized view that
// is missing or has a stale shape, so the caller should fall back to the raw
// logs table. Deliberately excluded: 42883 (undefined_function - our readers
// use only built-ins, so that is a code bug we want loud) and 0A000
// (cached-plan drift is structurally prevented by the two-pool connection
// lifecycle; masking it would hide a regression there).

// running whenever self-heal can trigger (a shape error requires the matview
// path to have been enabled, which requires the boot-time ensureMatViews that
// also starts the refresher). Future shape errors additionally re-trigger the

// failures are logged only; the raw fallback keeps serving in the meantime.
