// mvLogsHourlyDDL creates a materialized view that pre-aggregates logs into
// hourly buckets grouped by provider, model, status, object_type, and key IDs.
// Includes exact percentiles (p90/p95/p99) computed per hour so they can be
// re-aggregated via weighted averages across wider time ranges.
// canonical_model_name is a dimension despite being effectively functionally
// dependent on model: a bucket only splits transiently when a model's rows mix
// empty and populated canonical values (e.g. an alias gains model_name), and
// readers must re-aggregate per model via SUM / MAX(NULLIF(...)).
