// hand over what they verified as context values and this is the one place those are read: the
// user under its own keys, and any credential other than a header virtual key under
// BifrostContextKeyAuthCredential. The identity is recorded even when nothing was presented, so
// everything after the transport can tell "settled: nobody" from "not settled".
//
// ConvertToBifrostContext calls it for every request context it builds. It is exported for the
// paths that build a request context of their own, as a connection that authenticates at upgrade
// or an endpoint that evaluates a request it never forwards: they stamp what they know under the
// same context keys and settle it here, so what governance reads off them is what it reads off
// any other request. Settling again replaces the identity whole, so it is called once the last
// layer that can name the user or the credential has run.
//
// A virtual key presented in a header goes first, whatever else was recorded: a request that
// presents a key goes by the key, and whoever resolves the request's access decides how the user a
// session named relates to it. A direct key is not a credential at all: it selects which provider
// key serves the request and says nothing about who made it.
