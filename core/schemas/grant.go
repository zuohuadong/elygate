// What a request has been granted: who it is made by, what it may reach, and what pays for it.
//
// Every request carries one Grant, reached through its context. It is an envelope of sections that
// settle at different points as the request moves through the gateway. The Identity settles first,
// when the transport authenticates whatever the request presented. The Access settles once the
// permits the caller holds have been resolved, before anything decides where the request goes, and
// holds for the whole request: a fallback changes the provider, not the caller. The Limits settle
// per attempt, once the provider and model it will use are known, and are replaced whole for the
// next attempt. Each section is replaced rather than edited in place, so anything holding an
// earlier answer keeps reading it.
//
// This file declares the shapes and nothing else. What implements them, and where permits come
// from, is decided by whoever wires the gateway; core reads the answers and drives when each
// section is settled. A request that carries no Grant, or a Grant with no Access, is one nothing
// governs: it presented no credential and nothing granted it anything, so it reaches every
// provider, model, key and tool the deployment has, and a consumer that narrows something leaves
// it alone. That is a different thing from access that permits nothing, and consumers must tell
// the two apart.

// Grant is what a request has been granted, carried on its context for the life of the request.
//
// A nil section means not settled, which every reader has to tell apart from settled-and-empty: no
// access resolved is not access that permits nothing, and no limits resolved is not an attempt that
// answers to none.
//
// Any layer may replace a section, plugins included: a deployment that governs requests its own
// way changes what a request is attributed to, may reach, or answers to through the same sections
// everything else reads. Writes report whether they landed. Recording nothing is a no-op: a section
// can be replaced by a later answer but never emptied by one, because a reader cannot tell an
// emptied section from one that was never settled.

// that attributes the request, whether to a log row, a routing rule or a budget, reads it from here
// rather than looking any of it up again.
