// TestSTDIO_InitTimeout verifies that STDIO initialization fails gracefully
// when the subprocess cannot be launched (invalid command path).
//
// This test validates that:
// 1. Invalid subprocess paths are detected during Start() phase
// 2. The error is returned immediately (no hang)
// 3. Manager setup completes even when a client fails to connect
//
// Note: This tests the "subprocess launch failure" scenario. The timeout fix
// also handles "subprocess launches but doesn't respond" scenarios, which would
// require a mock server that launches but never sends Initialize response.
