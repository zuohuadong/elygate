# Playwright E2E Testing

Write, run, debug, and auto-update Playwright E2E tests following Bifrost's established patterns and conventions. Automatically detects UI changes and updates affected tests.

## Usage

```
/e2e-test <FEATURE_NAME>              # Create or update tests for a feature
/e2e-test fix <SPEC_FILE>             # Debug and fix a failing test
/e2e-test run <FEATURE_NAME>          # Run tests for a specific feature
/e2e-test run                         # Run all E2E tests
/e2e-test sync                        # Detect UI changes and update affected tests
/e2e-test sync <FEATURE_NAME>         # Sync tests for a specific feature with UI changes
/e2e-test audit                       # Audit all specs for incorrect/weak assertions
/e2e-test audit <FEATURE_NAME>        # Audit a specific feature's specs
```

## Workflow Overview

1. **Understand the feature** - Read the UI code to understand what needs testing
2. **Check existing tests** - Review existing test patterns for the feature or similar features
3. **Identify data-testid attributes** - Find selectors in the UI code
4. **Write/update tests** - Follow the established patterns (page objects, data factories, fixtures)
5. **Run the tests** - Execute and verify they pass
6. **Fix failures** - Debug and fix any issues

## Auto-Update Workflow (sync mode)

When invoked with `sync`, or when UI changes are detected, automatically update E2E tests:

### Step 0: Detect What Changed

Detect UI changes by checking git diff against the base branch:

```bash
# Get all changed UI files
git diff main --name-only -- 'ui/'

# Get changed files with diff content for analysis
git diff main -- 'ui/app/workspace/' 'ui/components/'
```

Categorize changes into:
- **data-testid changes** - Renamed, removed, or added test IDs
- **Route/URL changes** - Modified page routes or navigation paths
- **Component structure changes** - New/removed form fields, buttons, tables, dialogs
- **API endpoint changes** - Modified API calls that tests rely on
- **New features** - Entirely new pages or components that need test coverage

### Step 1: Map UI Changes to Affected Tests

For each changed UI file, find the corresponding test files:

```
UI File Path                              → Test Feature Folder
ui/app/workspace/providers/**             → tests/e2e/features/providers/
ui/app/workspace/virtual-keys/**          → tests/e2e/features/virtual-keys/
ui/app/workspace/dashboard/**             → tests/e2e/features/dashboard/
ui/app/workspace/logs/**                  → tests/e2e/features/logs/
ui/app/workspace/mcp-logs/**              → tests/e2e/features/mcp-logs/
ui/app/workspace/mcp-registry/**          → tests/e2e/features/mcp-registry/
ui/app/workspace/routing-rules/**         → tests/e2e/features/routing-rules/
ui/app/workspace/observability/**         → tests/e2e/features/observability/
ui/app/workspace/config/**                → tests/e2e/features/config/
ui/app/workspace/plugins/**              → tests/e2e/features/plugins/
ui/components/sidebar.tsx                 → tests/e2e/core/pages/sidebar.page.ts
ui/components/**                          → May affect multiple test features
```

### Step 2: Analyze Each Change Type and Update

**A. data-testid renamed or removed:**
1. Search the old testid across all test files: `grep -r 'old-testid' tests/e2e/`
2. Update every reference in page objects, selectors, and spec files
3. If a testid was removed without replacement, check if the element still exists with a different selector and add a new testid to the UI

**B. Form fields added/removed:**
1. If a new form field was added to a create/edit form:
   - Add the field to the page object's interface (e.g., `FeatureConfig`)
   - Add a locator for the field in the page object constructor
   - Update the `createFeature()` / `editFeature()` methods to fill the field
   - Update the data factory to include the new field with a default value
   - Add a test case that exercises the new field
2. If a form field was removed:
   - Remove it from the interface, locators, and methods
   - Remove or update test cases that depended on it

**C. New buttons/actions added:**
1. Add locators to the page object
2. Add methods to interact with the new action
3. Add test cases covering the new action

**D. Route changes:**
1. Update `goto()` methods in page objects
2. Update navigation helpers in `core/actions/navigation.ts`
3. Update any hardcoded URLs in test specs

**E. API endpoint changes:**
1. Update `core/actions/api.ts` helpers
2. Update any `waitForResponse()` URL patterns in page objects

**F. New page/feature added:**
1. Create the full test structure (page object, data factory, spec, fixture registration)
2. Follow Step 3 from the main workflow

### Step 3: Validate Updates

After making changes, run the affected tests to verify:

```bash
# Run only the affected feature tests
npx playwright test features/<affected-feature> --reporter=list

# If multiple features affected, run them all
npx playwright test features/providers features/virtual-keys --reporter=list
```

### Step 4: Report Changes

Present a summary to the user:
```
## E2E Test Sync Summary

### UI Changes Detected
- <list of changed UI files>

### Tests Updated
- **<feature>.page.ts**: Updated locators for renamed data-testid, added new field method
- **<feature>.spec.ts**: Added test for new "export" button, updated form fill sequence
- **<feature>.data.ts**: Added new field to factory defaults

### Tests Created
- **<new-feature>/**: Full test suite for new feature (page object, data, spec)

### Tests Requiring Manual Review
- <any changes that couldn't be auto-resolved, e.g., complex interaction flow changes>

### Verification
- Ran `npx playwright test features/<feature>` → X passed, Y failed
```

### Important: Proactive Sync Triggers

**ALWAYS** check for and sync E2E tests when ANY of these happen:

1. **You modify a UI component** that has `data-testid` attributes — check if tests reference those IDs
2. **You add a new `data-testid`** to a component — consider if existing tests should use it
3. **You rename or remove a component/prop** — search for test references and update them
4. **You change a form's fields** (add/remove inputs, change validation) — update page object methods and test data
5. **You modify an API route** that tests call — update API helpers and response wait patterns
6. **You change page navigation/routing** — update `goto()` methods and navigation helpers

To check quickly if tests are affected by your UI change:
```bash
# Find test files that reference any testid from the changed component
grep -rl 'data-testid-from-component' tests/e2e/
```

---

## Audit Workflow (audit mode) — Fix Incorrect Specs

Tests that pass but validate the wrong things are worse than no tests — they give false confidence. When invoked with `audit`, systematically scan specs for correctness issues and fix them.

### Step 0: Scope the Audit

```bash
# Audit all specs
/e2e-test audit

# Audit a specific feature
/e2e-test audit virtual-keys
```

If a specific feature is given, read only that feature's spec, page object, and data files. Otherwise, scan all `features/**/*.spec.ts` files.

### Step 1: Read the UI Code First

For every spec file being audited, **read the actual UI component code** to understand what the UI really does. This is the source of truth — tests must match real behavior, not assumed behavior.

```bash
# For each feature, read the UI code
# e.g. for virtual-keys:
grep -r 'data-testid' ui/app/workspace/virtual-keys/ --include='*.tsx'
```

Understand:
- What fields are in the create/edit form (from the UI code, not the test)
- What the save button actually does (API call, toast, sheet close)
- What the table actually renders (columns, row content, empty state)
- What validation rules exist (required fields, format checks)
- What error states exist (API failures, permission errors)

### Step 2: Scan for Incorrect Assertion Patterns

Check each spec file for these **anti-patterns** (ordered by severity):

#### P0 — Tests That Can Never Fail (always-true assertions)

These are the most dangerous — they provide zero coverage while appearing green.

```typescript
// WRONG: Always true — count is always >= 0
const count = await page.getCount()
expect(count >= 0).toBe(true)

// WRONG: Always true — empty string is a string
const text = await element.textContent()
expect(typeof text).toBe('string')

// WRONG: Always true — isVisible returns a boolean, not asserted correctly
const visible = await element.isVisible()
// (no assertion at all, or expect(visible).toBeDefined())

// WRONG: Catching error means it never fails
try { await doSomething(); expect(true).toBe(true) } catch { expect(true).toBe(true) }
```

**Fix:** Replace with deterministic assertions that verify actual expected state.

#### P1 — Tests That Assert Existence But Not Correctness

The test creates an item and checks it exists, but never verifies the item has the right data.

```typescript
// WEAK: Only checks existence, not content
await page.createVirtualKey({ name: 'Test VK', description: 'My desc', budget: { maxLimit: 100 } })
const exists = await page.virtualKeyExists('Test VK')
expect(exists).toBe(true)
// Never checks that description, budget, or other fields were actually saved correctly
```

**Fix:** After create, open/view the item and verify its fields match what was submitted. Compare against the actual UI state:
```typescript
// BETTER: Verify the data was saved correctly
await page.viewVirtualKey(vkData.name)
await expect(page.descriptionInput).toHaveValue('My desc')
await expect(page.page.locator('#budgetMaxLimit')).toHaveValue('100')
```

#### P2 — Tests That Assert the Wrong Thing

The test name says one thing but asserts something unrelated.

```typescript
// WRONG: Test says "should validate email" but only checks button state
test('should validate email format', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.fillEmail('invalid')
  await expect(page.saveBtn).toBeDisabled() // Tests button, not validation message
})

// WRONG: Test says "should delete" but only checks toast, not actual deletion
test('should delete item', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.deleteItem('foo')
  await page.waitForSuccessToast()
  // Never checks the item is actually gone from the table
})
```

**Fix:** Align assertions with test intent. A delete test must verify the item is gone. A validation test must check the validation message.

#### P3 — Tests With Swallowed Errors / Catch-All Handlers

Tests that catch errors and silently continue, hiding real failures.

```typescript
// WRONG: Error is caught and ignored — test always passes
const isVisible = await element.isVisible().catch(() => false)
if (isVisible) {
  expect(isVisible).toBe(true) // Only asserts when visible, silently passes when not
}

// WRONG: Optional assertion that can be skipped entirely
const providerSection = page.getByText(/Providers/i).first()
const isProviderVisible = await providerSection.isVisible().catch(() => false)
if (isProviderVisible) {
  expect(isProviderVisible).toBe(true) // Tautology when reached, skipped when not
}
```

**Fix:** Remove the catch/conditional and make the assertion unconditional. If the element should be visible, assert it directly:
```typescript
await expect(element).toBeVisible()
```

If the state genuinely depends on external factors, use count-based branching with **both** branches making meaningful assertions:
```typescript
const count = await page.getCount()
if (count === 0) {
  await expect(page.emptyState).toBeVisible()
} else {
  expect(count).toBeGreaterThan(0)
  await expect(page.emptyState).not.toBeVisible()
}
```

#### P4 — Tests That Don't Assert After Actions

Tests that perform actions (clicks, form fills, navigation) but have no assertion afterward.

```typescript
// WRONG: Action with no assertion — test only checks nothing throws
test('should toggle visibility', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.toggleKeyVisibility('my-key')
  await page.toggleKeyVisibility('my-key')
  // No assertion that the visibility state actually changed
})
```

**Fix:** Add assertions verifying the action's observable effect:
```typescript
test('should toggle visibility', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.toggleKeyVisibility('my-key')
  // Verify key value is now visible
  await expect(page.getKeyValueText('my-key')).toBeVisible()

  await page.toggleKeyVisibility('my-key')
  // Verify key value is now hidden again
  await expect(page.getKeyValueText('my-key')).not.toBeVisible()
})
```

#### P5 — Tests Asserting Against Stale State

Tests that read state before an action completes, or compare to a stale snapshot.

```typescript
// WRONG: Reads count before table finishes refreshing
await page.deleteItem('foo')
const count = await page.getCount() // Table hasn't refreshed yet!
expect(count).toBe(previousCount - 1) // May pass by coincidence
```

**Fix:** Wait for the state change to complete before asserting:
```typescript
await page.deleteItem('foo')
await page.waitForItemGone('foo') // Wait for table refresh
const count = await page.getCount()
expect(count).toBe(previousCount - 1)
```

#### P6 — Tests That Duplicate Other Tests Without Additional Value

Multiple tests covering the exact same code path with only cosmetic differences (different name strings, same logic).

```typescript
// REDUNDANT: These three tests do the same thing with different budget values
test('should create VK with small budget', ...)   // creates + checks exists
test('should create VK with medium budget', ...)  // creates + checks exists
test('should create VK with daily budget', ...)   // creates + checks exists
// None of them verify the budget value was saved correctly
```

**Fix:** Either consolidate into a parameterized test, or make each test verify something unique (e.g., verify the actual budget value appears in the UI).

### Step 3: Cross-Check Against UI Code

For each test, verify:

1. **Form fields match** - Does the test fill all required fields from the UI? Does it test fields that actually exist?
2. **Selectors are correct** - Does `data-testid="vk-name-input"` actually exist in the current UI code? Has it been renamed?
3. **Behavior matches** - If the UI shows a confirmation dialog on delete, does the test handle it? If the form has validation, do tests exercise it?
4. **Error paths exist** - Does the UI show error toasts? Are there tests for error scenarios?
5. **New UI capabilities untested** - Has the UI added new features (export, filter, sort, pagination) that have no test coverage?

```bash
# Compare what testids exist in UI vs what tests reference
grep -roh 'data-testid="[^"]*"' ui/app/workspace/<feature>/ | sort -u > /tmp/ui-testids.txt
grep -roh "getByTestId('[^']*')\|getByTestId(\"[^\"]*\")" tests/e2e/features/<feature>/ | sort -u > /tmp/test-testids.txt
# Diff to find gaps
diff /tmp/ui-testids.txt /tmp/test-testids.txt
```

### Step 4: Fix and Strengthen

For each issue found:

1. **Read the UI code** for that specific component/interaction
2. **Understand the expected behavior** from the UI implementation
3. **Rewrite the assertion** to verify actual, observable, correct state
4. **Run the fixed test** to ensure it passes with correct behavior and **would fail** if the behavior broke

### Step 5: Report Findings

Present results to the user:

```
## E2E Audit Report — <feature>

### Issues Found: X

#### P0 — Always-True Assertions (X found)
| Test | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| "should show empty state" | vk.spec.ts:374 | `count >= 0` always true | Use count-based branching |

#### P1 — Missing Data Verification (X found)
| Test | File:Line | Issue | Fix |
|------|-----------|-------|-----|
| "should create with budget" | vk.spec.ts:108 | Only checks `exists`, not budget value | Add field verification after create |

#### P2 — Wrong Assertion Target (X found)
...

#### P3 — Swallowed Errors (X found)
...

#### P4 — Missing Assertions (X found)
...

#### P5 — Stale State (X found)

            └── <feature>.page.ts  # Page object extending BasePage
```

## Step 1: Understand the Feature

Before writing tests, read the relevant UI code to understand:

- What pages/routes exist for the feature
- What `data-testid` attributes are already in the UI components
- What CRUD operations are available
- What form fields, buttons, and interactive elements exist
- What API endpoints the UI calls

**Search for data-testid in UI code:**
```bash
# Find all data-testid attributes for a feature
grep -r 'data-testid' ui/app/workspace/<feature>/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts'
```

**Check what routes exist:**
```bash
ls ui/app/workspace/
```

## Step 2: Check Existing Tests

Always review existing patterns before writing new tests:

```bash
# List all existing feature test folders
ls tests/e2e/features/

# Read an existing spec for patterns
cat tests/e2e/features/virtual-keys/virtual-keys.spec.ts

# Read existing page objects for patterns
cat tests/e2e/features/virtual-keys/pages/virtual-keys.page.ts
```

## Step 3: Create the Feature Test Structure

For a new feature, create these files:

### 3a. Page Object (`features/<feature>/pages/<feature>.page.ts`)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Always extend `BasePage`
- Define all locators in the constructor using `page.getByTestId()`
- Use `data-testid` attributes as the primary selector strategy
- Use `page.getByRole()` as a secondary strategy
- NEVER use brittle CSS selectors or chained parent locators (`.locator('..')`)
- Methods should be async and use semantic waits
- Include `goto()`, CRUD methods, and a `cleanup` method

**Template:**
```typescript
import { Locator, Page, expect } from '@playwright/test'
import { BasePage } from '../../../core/pages/base.page'
import { waitForNetworkIdle } from '../../../core/utils/test-helpers'

// Define interfaces for the feature's data
export interface FeatureConfig {
  name: string
  description?: string
  // ... other fields
}

export class FeaturePage extends BasePage {
  // Main page elements
  readonly createBtn: Locator
  readonly table: Locator

  // Sheet/form elements
  readonly sheet: Locator
  readonly nameInput: Locator
  readonly saveBtn: Locator
  readonly cancelBtn: Locator

  constructor(page: Page) {
    super(page)

    // Use getByTestId for all locators
    this.createBtn = page.getByTestId('create-feature-btn')
    this.table = page.getByTestId('feature-table')
    this.sheet = page.getByTestId('feature-sheet')
    this.nameInput = page.getByTestId('feature-name-input')
    this.saveBtn = page.getByTestId('feature-save-btn')
    this.cancelBtn = page.getByTestId('feature-cancel-btn')
  }

  async goto(): Promise<void> {
    await this.page.goto('/workspace/<feature>')
    await waitForNetworkIdle(this.page)
  }

  async createFeature(config: FeatureConfig): Promise<void> {
    await this.createBtn.click()
    await expect(this.sheet).toBeVisible()
    await this.waitForSheetAnimation()

    // Fill form fields
    await this.nameInput.fill(config.name)

    // Save
    await this.saveBtn.click()
    await this.waitForSuccessToast()
    await this.dismissToasts()
    await expect(this.sheet).not.toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 })
  }

  async featureExists(name: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const row = this.page.getByTestId(`feature-row-${name}`)
    return (await row.count()) > 0
  }

  async deleteFeature(name: string): Promise<void> {
    const deleteBtn = this.page.getByTestId(`feature-delete-btn-${name}`)
    await deleteBtn.click()

    // Handle confirmation dialog
    const confirmDialog = this.page.locator('[role="alertdialog"]')
    await confirmDialog.waitFor({ state: 'visible', timeout: 5000 })
    const confirmBtn = confirmDialog.getByRole('button', { name: /Delete/i })
    await confirmBtn.click()

    await this.waitForSuccessToast()
    await this.dismissToasts()
  }

  async closeSheet(): Promise<void> {
    const isSheetVisible = await this.sheet.isVisible().catch(() => false)
    if (isSheetVisible) {
      const closeBtn = this.sheet.locator('button[aria-label*="close"], button:has(svg.lucide-x)').first()
      if (await closeBtn.isVisible()) {
        await closeBtn.click()
      }
      await expect(this.sheet).not.toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 }).catch(() => {})
    }
  }

  async cleanupFeatures(names: string[]): Promise<void> {
    if (names.length === 0) return
    await this.goto()
    await this.closeSheet()
    await this.dismissToasts()
    for (const name of names) {
      try {
        const exists = await this.featureExists(name)
        if (!exists) continue
        await this.closeSheet()
        await this.deleteFeature(name)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`[CLEANUP] Failed to delete: ${name}`)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3b. Test Data Factory (`features/<feature>/<feature>.data.ts`)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Use `Date.now()` for unique test names
- Provide factory functions with sensible defaults
- Allow partial overrides via the spread pattern
- Create sample constant objects for reusable configurations
- **Never marshal payloads to a `Record`/`Map` and re-serialize** — field ordering matters for backend validation and snapshot comparisons. Always construct payloads as object literals with fields in the intended order. Do NOT use `Object.fromEntries()`, `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(...))` round-trips, or destructure into an intermediate `Record<string, unknown>` — these can reorder fields.

**Template:**
```typescript
import { FeatureConfig } from './pages/feature.page'

export function createFeatureData(overrides: Partial<FeatureConfig> = {}): FeatureConfig {
  const timestamp = Date.now()
  return {
    name: `Test Feature ${timestamp}`,
    description: 'E2E test feature',
    // ... sensible defaults
    ...overrides,
  }
}

// Sample configurations for different scenarios
export const SAMPLE_CONFIGS = {
  basic: { /* ... */ },
  advanced: { /* ... */ },
} as const
```

### 3c. Test Spec (`features/<feature>/<feature>.spec.ts`)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Import `test` and `expect` from `../../core/fixtures/base.fixture`
- Track created resources in arrays for cleanup in `afterEach`
- Use `test.describe()` blocks for logical grouping
- Use `test.beforeEach()` to navigate to the page
- Use `test.afterEach()` to clean up resources
- Use unique names with `Date.now()` for test data
- Write deterministic assertions (never `expect(count >= 0).toBe(true)`)
- Use `test.describe.configure({ mode: 'serial' })` when tests have write ordering dependencies
- **Never marshal API payloads to a `Record`/`Map`** — pass object literals directly to Playwright's `request.post({ data })`. Marshaling through an intermediate map can reorder fields, which breaks backend validation and snapshot comparisons.

**Template:**
```typescript
import { expect, test } from '../../core/fixtures/base.fixture'
import { createFeatureData } from './feature.data'

const createdItems: string[] = []

test.describe('Feature Name', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ featurePage }) => {
    await featurePage.goto()
  })

  test.afterEach(async ({ featurePage }) => {
    await featurePage.closeSheet()
    if (createdItems.length > 0) {
      await featurePage.cleanupFeatures([...createdItems])
      createdItems.length = 0
    }
  })

  test.describe('Creation', () => {
    test('should display create button', async ({ featurePage }) => {
      await expect(featurePage.createBtn).toBeVisible()
    })

    test('should create a basic item', async ({ featurePage }) => {
      const data = createFeatureData({ name: `Basic Test ${Date.now()}` })
      createdItems.push(data.name)

      await featurePage.createFeature(data)

      const exists = await featurePage.featureExists(data.name)
      expect(exists).toBe(true)
    })
  })

  test.describe('Deletion', () => {
    test('should delete item', async ({ featurePage }) => {
      const data = createFeatureData({ name: `Delete Test ${Date.now()}` })
      await featurePage.createFeature(data)

      let exists = await featurePage.featureExists(data.name)
      expect(exists).toBe(true)

      await featurePage.deleteFeature(data.name)
      // No need to track for cleanup since we just deleted it

      exists = await featurePage.featureExists(data.name)
      expect(exists).toBe(false)
    })
  })
})
```

### 3d. Register the Page Object in Fixtures

If creating a brand new feature, add it to `core/fixtures/base.fixture.ts`:

1. Import the page class
2. Add to `BifrostFixtures` type
3. Add fixture definition

```typescript
// In base.fixture.ts
import { FeaturePage } from '../../features/<feature>/pages/<feature>.page'

type BifrostFixtures = {
  // ... existing
  featurePage: FeaturePage
}

export const test = base.extend<BifrostFixtures>({
  // ... existing
  featurePage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await use(new FeaturePage(page))
  },
})
```

### 3e. Add npm Script (optional)

In `tests/e2e/package.json`, add a feature-specific test script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:<feature>": "playwright test features/<feature>"
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Run Tests

```bash
# From tests/e2e/ directory
cd tests/e2e

# Run all tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific feature
npx playwright test features/<feature>

# Run in headed mode (see the browser)
npx playwright test features/<feature> --headed

# Run with Playwright UI (interactive)
npx playwright test --ui

# Run with debug inspector
npx playwright test features/<feature> --debug

# Run a single test by title
npx playwright test -g "should create a basic item"

# From project root via Makefile
make run-e2e FLOW=<feature>
make run-e2e-headed FLOW=<feature>
```

**Environment variables:**
- `BASE_URL` - Override app URL (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `BIFROST_BASE_URL` - Override Bifrost API URL (default: http://localhost:8080)
- `SKIP_WEB_SERVER=1` - Skip auto-starting Vite dev server
- `CI=1` - Enable CI mode (retries, serial execution)

## Step 5: Debug Failing Tests

### Common Issues and Fixes

**1. Element not found / timeout:**
- Check if the `data-testid` attribute exists in the UI component
- Verify the page has loaded: add `await waitForNetworkIdle(page)` after navigation
- Check for loading spinners: `await page.locator('[data-testid="loading-spinner"]').waitFor({ state: 'hidden' })`

**2. Toast interfering with clicks:**
- Dismiss toasts before interactions: `await page.dismissToasts()` or `await page.forceCloseToasts()`

**3. Sheet/dialog animation not complete:**
- Wait for animation: `await page.waitForSheetAnimation()`
- Wait for sheet visibility: `await expect(sheet).toBeVisible()`

**4. Stale element after table refresh:**
- Re-query the locator after data changes (don't reuse old locator references)
- Use polling patterns like `waitForVirtualKeyGone()` for eventual consistency

**5. Tests pass individually but fail together:**
- Check cleanup: ensure `afterEach` deletes all created resources
- Use unique names with `Date.now()` timestamps
- Check for state pollution between test files

**6. Flaky Radix/Shadcn Select:**
- Use the `fillSelect()` helper from `core/utils/test-helpers.ts`
- Wait for `[role="listbox"]` to appear before clicking options
- Wait for `[role="listbox"]` to disappear after selection

### Debugging Tools

```bash
# View the HTML report of the last run
npx playwright show-report

# Generate test code by recording browser actions
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000

# Run with trace viewer (records every action)
npx playwright test --trace on
```

### Trace and Screenshots

- **Screenshots:** Taken automatically on failure, saved to `test-results/`
- **Traces:** Captured on first retry, viewable via `npx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>`
- **Videos:** Retained on failure, saved to `test-results/`

## Mandatory Rules

These rules MUST be followed at all times:

### Selectors
- **ALWAYS** use `data-testid` attributes as the primary selector strategy
- **ALWAYS** use `page.getByTestId()` or `page.getByRole()` - never raw CSS selectors for interactive elements
- **NEVER** use chained parent locators (`.locator('..')`)
- **NEVER** use `{ force: true }` on clicks - fix the underlying visibility issue instead
- If a needed `data-testid` doesn't exist in the UI, add it to the UI component first

### Waits
- **ALWAYS** use semantic waits (`waitFor()`, `expect().toBeVisible()`, `waitForLoadState()`)
- **NEVER** use `page.waitForTimeout()` except as last resort in cleanup/polling (and document why)
- **ALWAYS** wait for page load after navigation: `await waitForNetworkIdle(page)`
- **ALWAYS** wait for sheet animations before interacting with sheet contents

### Test Data
- **ALWAYS** use `Date.now()` or `TestDataFactory.uniqueId()` for unique test names
- **NEVER** use static/hardcoded test data names (causes collisions in parallel runs)
- **ALWAYS** create test data factory functions in `<feature>.data.ts`

### Cleanup
- **ALWAYS** track created resources in arrays and delete them in `afterEach`
- **ALWAYS** close open sheets before cleanup: `await page.closeSheet()`
- **ALWAYS** dismiss toasts before interactive operations
- Cleanup failures should `console.error` and continue, never throw

### Assertions
- **ALWAYS** write deterministic assertions that can actually fail
- **NEVER** write `expect(count >= 0).toBe(true)` - this always passes
- Use count-based branching for state-dependent assertions:
  ```typescript
  if (count === 0) {
    await expect(emptyState).toBeVisible()
  } else {
    expect(count).toBeGreaterThan(0)
  }
  ```

### Imports
- **ALWAYS** import `test` and `expect` from `../../core/fixtures/base.fixture`
- **NEVER** import directly from `@playwright/test` in spec files (use the custom fixture)

### Adding data-testid to UI

When a UI component is missing a required `data-testid`, add it directly. Convention:
```
data-testid="<entity>-<element>-<qualifier>"

Examples:
  data-testid="vk-row-{name}"           # Virtual key table row
  data-testid="vk-edit-btn-{name}"      # Edit button for specific VK
  data-testid="vk-delete-btn-{name}"    # Delete button for specific VK
  data-testid="create-vk-btn"           # Create button
  data-testid="vk-sheet"                # Virtual key form sheet
  data-testid="vk-name-input"           # Name input in VK form
  data-testid="vk-save-btn"             # Save button in VK form
```
