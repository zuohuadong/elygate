# Investigate GitHub Issue

Fetch a GitHub issue, analyze the report, search the codebase for relevant code, research external documentation, and present a comprehensive implementation plan with side-effect analysis and test guidance. 

**Your final report MUST contain all of these sections:**
1. Issue Details (from Step 1)
2. Classification (from Step 2)
3. Codebase Analysis + Documentation Research (from Step 3, including sub-step 3e)
4. Impact Analysis (from Step 4)
5. Test Plan (from Step 5)
6. Full Presentation (Step 6 template)

If any section is missing, go back and complete it before presenting the report.

## Usage

```
/investigate-issue <ISSUE_ID>           # Investigate issue by number
/investigate-issue                      # Prompts for issue ID
```

## Workflow Overview

1. **Get the issue** -- Fetch full issue details from GitHub
2. **Classify the issue** -- Determine type (bug, feature, docs) and affected areas
3. **Search the codebase and research docs** -- Find relevant code, then research the libraries it depends on via Context7 and WebSearch
4. **Analyze impact** -- Cross-reference codebase findings with documentation to identify side effects, dependencies, and breaking changes
5. **Suggest tests** -- If changes touch `core/`, recommend specific LLM and MCP test additions
6. **Present the plan** -- Show findings and recommended changes to the user
7. **Implement with approval** -- After plan approval, make changes one at a time with user confirmation

## Step 1: Fetch the Issue

If no issue ID is provided, ask the user:
```
What is the GitHub issue number you want to investigate?
```

The repository is always `maximhq/bifrost`.

Fetch full issue details:
```bash
# Get issue with all metadata
gh issue view <ISSUE_ID> --repo maximhq/bifrost --json number,title,body,labels,assignees,state,comments,author,createdAt,updatedAt

# Get issue comments for additional context
gh issue view <ISSUE_ID> --repo maximhq/bifrost --json comments --jq '.comments[].body'
```

If the issue does not exist or `gh` fails:
- Check authentication: `gh auth status`
- Verify the issue number is valid: `gh issue list --repo maximhq/bifrost --limit 5 --json number,title`
- Report the error and ask the user for a corrected issue ID

## Step 2: Classify the Issue

### 2a. Determine Issue Type

Parse the issue title prefix and labels to classify:

| Title Prefix | Label | Type | Investigation Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[Bug]:` | `bug` | Bug | Reproduce, find root cause, identify fix |
| `[Feature]:` | `enhancement` | Feature | Design approach, find insertion points |
| `[Docs]:` | `documentation` | Docs | Find affected doc pages, verify accuracy |
| (none) | (any) | General | Read body carefully, infer type from content |

### 2b. Determine Affected Areas

Use the issue's labels and body content to map to codebase areas. The issue templates include an "Affected area(s)" field with these values:

| Area Label | Codebase Directories | Key Files |
|---|---|---|
| Core (Go) | `core/`, `core/schemas/`, `core/providers/`, `core/mcp/` | `core/bifrost.go`, `core/utils.go` |
| Framework | `framework/`, `framework/configstore/`, `framework/logstore/` | `framework/config.go`, `framework/list.go` |
| Transports (HTTP) | `transports/bifrost-http/` | `transports/bifrost-http/` |
| Plugins | `plugins/` (governance, jsonparser, litellmcompat, etc.) | Plugin-specific `go.mod` files |
| UI (React) | `ui/`, `ui/app/workspace/`, `ui/components/` | Feature-specific workspace pages |
| Docs | `docs/` | `docs/docs.json`, feature-specific `.mdx` files |

If the issue body mentions specific providers (e.g., "openai", "anthropic", "gemini"), also search:
```bash
ls core/providers/
# Maps to: core/providers/<provider_name>/
```

If the issue mentions MCP, agents, or tools, also search:
```bash
ls core/mcp/
# Key: core/mcp/agent.go, core/mcp/codemode.go, core/mcp/toolmanager.go
```

### 2c. Extract Key Information

From the issue body, extract and summarize:
- **What is reported** -- The specific problem or request
- **Reproduction steps** -- If bug, how to trigger it
- **Expected vs actual behavior** -- What should happen vs what happens
- **Version info** -- Which version is affected
- **Environment details** -- OS, Go version, Node version, etc.
- **Code snippets** -- Any code the reporter included
- **Error messages** -- Stack traces, logs, error output

## Step 3: Search the Codebase

Systematically search for all code relevant to the issue. Use multiple search strategies:

### 3a. Keyword Search

Extract key terms from the issue and search:
```bash
# Search for error messages mentioned in the issue
grep -rn "exact error message" core/ framework/ transports/ ui/

# Search for function/type names mentioned
grep -rn "FunctionName\|TypeName" --include='*.go' core/
grep -rn "componentName\|functionName" --include='*.ts' --include='*.tsx' ui/

# Search for API endpoints mentioned
grep -rn "/api/endpoint" transports/ ui/
```

### 3b. Structural Search by Area

Based on the affected area, do targeted exploration:

**For Core (Go) issues:**
```bash
# Find the specific provider if mentioned
ls core/providers/<provider>/
grep -rn "relevantFunction" core/providers/<provider>/

# Check schemas for relevant types
grep -rn "TypeName" core/schemas/ --include='*.go'

# Check the main bifrost.go for relevant handlers
grep -n "functionName\|handlerName" core/bifrost.go
```

**For MCP/Agent issues:**
```bash
# Search agent code
grep -rn "keyword" core/mcp/ --include='*.go'

# Check codemode if relevant
ls core/mcp/codemode/
grep -rn "keyword" core/mcp/codemode/ --include='*.go'
```

**For UI issues:**
```bash
# Find the workspace page
ls ui/app/workspace/<feature>/

# Search for components
grep -rn "keyword" ui/app/workspace/<feature>/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts'
grep -rn "keyword" ui/components/ --include='*.tsx' --include='*.ts'

# Check for data-testid attributes (relevant for E2E impact)
grep -rn 'data-testid' ui/app/workspace/<feature>/ --include='*.tsx'
```

**For Framework issues:**
```bash
grep -rn "keyword" framework/ --include='*.go'
ls framework/configstore/ framework/logstore/ framework/plugins/
```

**For Plugin issues:**
```bash
# Identify which plugin
ls plugins/
grep -rn "keyword" plugins/<plugin_name>/ --include='*.go'
```

**For Docs issues:**
```bash
# Find the affected documentation page
find docs/ -name "*.mdx" | head -30
grep -rn "keyword" docs/ --include='*.mdx'
```

### 3c. Dependency Tracing

For any function or type identified as needing changes, trace its callers and dependents:
```bash
# Find all callers of a function
grep -rn "FunctionName(" --include='*.go' core/ framework/ transports/ plugins/

# Find all implementations of an interface
grep -rn "InterfaceName" --include='*.go' core/ framework/

# Find all imports of a package
grep -rn '"github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core/schemas"' --include='*.go' .
```

### 3d. Find Related Tests

```bash
# Find existing tests for the affected code
grep -rn "TestFunctionName\|Test.*Relevant" --include='*_test.go' core/ framework/ transports/

# Check LLM tests
grep -rn "keyword" core/internal/llmtests/ --include='*.go'

# Check MCP tests
grep -rn "keyword" core/internal/mcptests/ --include='*_test.go'

# Check E2E tests if UI is affected
grep -rn "keyword" tests/e2e/ --include='*.ts'
```

### 3e. Research External Documentation

Now that you've found the relevant code, research the external libraries it depends on. This informs the impact analysis in Step 4.

**Identify libraries from the code you found:**
```bash
# Check go.mod for dependencies relevant to the issue
cat core/go.mod | grep -v "^$" | grep -v "//"

# For UI issues, check package.json
cat ui/package.json | jq '.dependencies, .devDependencies'
```

**Query Context7 for each relevant library:**
```
# Step 1: Resolve the library ID
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id(
  libraryName: "<library name from go.mod or package.json>",
  query: "<issue title + key terms>"
)

# Step 2: Query the docs with the resolved ID
mcp__context7__query-docs(
  libraryId: "<result from step 1>",
  query: "<specific question about behavior relevant to the issue>"
)
```

Common libraries: `mark3labs/mcp-go` (MCP protocol), `stretchr/testify` (test assertions), `react` (UI framework), `playwright` (E2E testing), provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

**Search the web for additional context:**
```
WebSearch: "<error message or behavior from the issue> <library name>"
WebSearch: "<library name> best practices <relevant pattern>"
```

**Record your findings in this table** (you will copy it into the final report in Step 6):

| Source | Query Used | Key Finding | Link |
|--------|-----------|-------------|------|
| Context7: `<library>` | `<query>` | `<what was learned, or "No relevant docs found">` | `<link if available>` |
| WebSearch | `<query>` | `<what was learned, or "No relevant results">` | `<URL>` |

If no useful results are found for a library, still include a row with "No relevant documentation found" and note what was searched. This transparency helps the user understand research coverage.

## Step 4: Analyze Impact

Using both the codebase search results (Step 3a-3d) and the documentation research (Step 3e), analyze the impact of the proposed changes. For each file, note whether library documentation revealed any constraints or best practices that affect the implementation.

### 4a. Direct Changes Required

For each file that needs modification, document:
- **File path** (absolute)
- **What to change** (function, type, handler, component)
- **Why** (ties back to the issue)
- **How** (specific approach -- add parameter, modify logic, new function, etc.)
- **Library constraints** (from Step 3e research -- any API contracts, deprecations, or version requirements)

### 4b. Side Effects Analysis

For each proposed change, trace the blast radius:

**Code side effects:**
```bash
# Who calls this function?
grep -rn "FunctionToChange(" --include='*.go' core/ framework/ transports/ plugins/

# Who uses this type?
grep -rn "TypeToChange" --include='*.go' core/ framework/ transports/ plugins/

# What tests exercise this code?
grep -rn "FunctionToChange\|TestRelated" --include='*_test.go' core/ framework/ transports/
```

**Schema side effects (if changing types in core/schemas/):**
- Check all providers that implement the schema
- Check framework code that serializes/deserializes the type
- Check UI code that consumes the API response
- Check plugin code that uses the schema

**API side effects (if changing endpoints):**
- Check all UI pages that call the endpoint
- Check E2E tests that hit the endpoint
- Check documentation that references the endpoint

**UI side effects (if changing components):**
- Check all pages that use the component
- Check E2E tests with selectors targeting the component
- Check if data-testid attributes change

### 4c. Breaking Change Assessment

Classify the change:
- **Non-breaking** -- Internal refactor, bug fix with same API surface
- **Minor breaking** -- New required parameter with default, deprecation
- **Major breaking** -- Changed API signature, removed field, behavioral change

## Step 5: Test Recommendations

### 5a. General Test Guidance

For ANY code change, identify:
- Existing tests that need updating
- New test cases that should be added
- Edge cases to cover

### 5b. LLM Tests (when changes touch `core/` or `core/providers/`)

The LLM test infrastructure lives in `core/internal/llmtests/`. Key patterns:

**Test structure:**
- Each scenario is a self-contained Go file with a `Run{Scenario}Test()` function
- Signature: `func Run{Scenario}Test(t *testing.T, client *bifrost.Bifrost, ctx context.Context, testConfig ComprehensiveTestConfig)`
- Tests run against both Chat Completions and Responses APIs (dual-API testing)

**How to add a new LLM test:**
1. Create a new file in `core/internal/llmtests/` named after the scenario (e.g., `new_scenario.go`)
2. Implement `RunNewScenarioTest()` following the signature pattern
3. Register it in `core/internal/llmtests/tests.go` by adding to the `testScenarios` slice
4. Add a `Scenarios` flag in `ComprehensiveTestConfig` to enable/disable it
5. Use `validation_presets.go` expectations (e.g., `BasicChatExpectations()`, `ToolCallExpectations()`)
6. Use the retry framework from `test_retry_framework.go` for validation failures

**Example test recommendation format:**
```
New LLM test: Run{X}Test in core/internal/llmtests/{x}.go
- Scenario: <what it tests>
- Expectations: <which validation preset to use>
- Dual-API: Yes, test both Chat Completions and Responses API paths
- Register in: tests.go testScenarios slice
- Config flag: Scenarios.{X} in ComprehensiveTestConfig
```

**Running LLM tests:**
```bash
make test-core PROVIDER=<provider> TESTCASE=<TestName>
make test-core PROVIDER=<provider> PATTERN=<substring>
```

### 5c. MCP Tests (when changes touch `core/mcp/`)

The MCP test infrastructure lives in `core/internal/mcptests/`. Key patterns:

**Test structure:**
- Standard Go test functions: `func TestScenario(t *testing.T)`
- Setup via `SetupAgentTest(t, AgentTestConfig{...})` which returns `(manager, mocker, ctx)`
- Mock LLM responses via `DynamicLLMMocker` with a response queue
- Agent tests use `MockLLMCaller` with pre-defined response sequences

**How to add a new MCP test:**
1. Identify which test file category it belongs to:
   - `agent_*_test.go` -- Agent loop behavior tests
   - `tool_*_test.go` -- Tool execution tests
   - `connection_*_test.go` -- Client connection tests
   - `codemode_*_test.go` -- CodeMode-specific tests
2. Create the test function following existing patterns
3. Use `AgentTestConfig` for declarative setup:
   ```go
   manager, mocker, ctx := SetupAgentTest(t, AgentTestConfig{
       InProcessTools:   []string{"echo", "calculator"},
       AutoExecuteTools: []string{"*"},
       MaxDepth:         5,
   })
   ```
4. Use assertion helpers: `AssertAgentCompletedInTurns()`, `AssertToolExecutedInTurn()`
5. Use fixture helpers from `fixtures.go` for mock responses

**Example test recommendation format:**
```
New MCP test: Test{X} in core/internal/mcptests/{category}_test.go
- Category: agent | tool | connection | codemode
- Setup: AgentTestConfig with {tools} and {config}
- Mock responses: {describe the LLM response sequence}
- Assertions: {what to verify}
```

**Running MCP tests:**
```bash
make test-mcp TESTCASE=<TestName>
make test-mcp TYPE=<category> PATTERN=<substring>
```

### 5d. E2E Tests (when changes touch `ui/`)

If UI changes are involved, recommend E2E test updates following the patterns in `tests/e2e/`:
- Page objects in `tests/e2e/features/<feature>/pages/`
- Specs in `tests/e2e/features/<feature>/`
- Reference the `/e2e-test` skill for full E2E test creation workflow
- **Never marshal API payloads to a `Record`/`Map`** — construct payloads as object literals with fields in the intended order and pass directly to Playwright's `request.post({ data })`. Marshaling through intermediate maps can reorder fields, breaking backend validation and snapshot comparisons.

```bash
make run-e2e FLOW=<feature>
```

## Step 6: Present Findings

Present everything to the user in this structured format:

```
## Issue Investigation: #<ID> -- <Title>

### Issue Classification
- **Type:** Bug / Feature / Docs

- **Scope:** Small (1-2 files) / Medium (3-5 files) / Large (6+ files)
- **Risk:** Low / Medium / High

---

**Proceed with implementation?** (yes / no / modify plan)
```

## Step 7: Implement with Per-Change Approval

Once the user approves the plan:

### 7a. Create a Todo List

Create a todo item for each change in the plan:
```
1. Change 1: <description> -- pending
2. Change 2: <description> -- pending
3. Update test: <description> -- pending
4. Add new test: <description> -- pending
5. Verify all tests pass -- pending
```

### 7b. For Each Change

Before making any edit, present the change to the user:

```
## Change <N>/<Total>: <File path>

**What:** <description of the change>

**Current code:**
<existing code that will be modified>

**Proposed change:**
<new code after modification>

**Apply this change?** (yes / no / modify)
```

Wait for user approval before applying. If user says "no", skip and move to the next change. If user says "modify", discuss and adjust.

### 7c. After All Changes

Once all approved changes are applied:

1. Run relevant tests:
   ```bash
   # For core changes
   make test-core PROVIDER=<relevant_provider> PATTERN=<relevant_test>

   # For MCP changes
   make test-mcp PATTERN=<relevant_test>

   # For framework changes
   cd framework && go test ./...

   # For UI changes
   make run-e2e FLOW=<feature>
   ```

2. Report results to the user
3. If tests fail, investigate and propose fixes (with approval)

## Error Handling

### Issue Not Found
```
Issue #<ID> was not found in maximhq/bifrost.
- Verify the issue number is correct
- Run: gh issue list --repo maximhq/bifrost --limit 10 --json number,title
```

### gh CLI Not Authenticated
```
GitHub CLI is not authenticated. Run:
  gh auth login
Then retry /investigate-issue <ID>
```

### No Relevant Code Found
If codebase search yields no results:
1. Broaden the search terms
2. Search for related concepts instead of exact matches
3. Ask the user for more context about where the code might live
4. Check if this is a net-new feature with no existing code

### External Documentation Not Found
If Context7 or WebSearch yield no useful results in Step 3e:
1. Still include a row in the research table with "No relevant documentation found" and note what was searched
2. Proceed with codebase analysis alone
3. Flag areas where documentation review might be needed before implementation
