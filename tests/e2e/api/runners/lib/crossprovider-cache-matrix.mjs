//
// (createHash is used only to bound prompt_cache_key to OpenAI's 64-char limit; see cacheKeyFor.)
//
// WHAT THIS TESTS THAT THE OTHER TWO CACHE FOLDERS DON'T
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// midconv-system-cache-parity.mjs proves one converter (Bedrock) drops one breakpoint, measured
// against a hand-built direct Converse payload. prompt-caching-extension.mjs proves a cache read
// happens at all, single-turn, on five backends. Neither answers the question a gateway actually
// has to answer: does the SAME conversation cache the SAME way no matter which provider is behind
// it? That is the gateway's promise, and it is only testable by sweeping providers x models.
//
// So this folder sweeps 34 (provider, model) cells covering three model families, both the
// Anthropic and OpenAI families on each of bedrock/vertex/azure, and several generations back per
// provider. A Claude cell that caches on one provider and not another is a finding regardless of
// whether the underlying transform is "documented": the client sent the same bytes and got
// different economics.
//
// TWO ARMS
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   control - a plain multi-turn conversation, no mid-conversation system message
//   midconv - the same conversation plus a mid-conversation role:"system" turn
//
// The arms are NOT compared to each other - they carry different content, so they hold different
// cache entries by construction. Each arm is compared to ITSELF across rounds.
//
// TWO BARS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO CACHING MECHANISMS
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// An earlier revision of this file held every cell to one 0.85 floor. That was wrong, and the
// error is worth recording because it is easy to repeat: a uniform floor assumes a warm,
// byte-identical repeat DETERMINISTICALLY reads back. That holds for explicit cache_control
// breakpoints. It is simply not on offer for implicit caching.
//
// Measured directly against Google, with no gateway in the path, four consecutive byte-identical
// requests produced: gemini-2.5-pro 0%/0%/78%/0%, gemini-2.5-flash 0%/97%/0%/0%,
// gemini-3-flash-preview 0%/52%/52%/52%. The hit rate flips between zero and a fixed per-model
// plateau with no discernible pattern, and the plateau itself (52% / 78% / 97%) is block
// granularity, not a defect. A single round-2 sample of that is a coin flip reported as a verdict.
//
//   explicit (Claude, cache_control) - 2 rounds; round 2 must clear HIT_RATE_FLOOR. Deterministic,
//     so a miss is a real gateway defect: a dropped breakpoint or a perturbed prefix.
//   implicit (OpenAI/Gemini)         - IMPLICIT_ROUNDS rounds; asserts only that caching engaged
//     at least once, and REPORTS the per-round series plus the best. That catches "the gateway
//     broke caching entirely" while refusing to manufacture a verdict out of provider variance.
//
// OpenAI additionally routes cache lookups by prefix hash, so back-to-back requests can land on
// different machines and miss for reasons unrelated to the payload. Cells on the openai provider
// therefore send prompt_cache_key for affinity - the same thing the collection's hand-written
// Round 31 caching rows do.
//
// SIZING: WHY EVERY SEGMENT IS ~5.9K TOKENS AND NOT SMALLER
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The minimum cacheable prompt is per-model and NOT monotonic across generations: 512 tokens on
// Opus 5, 1024 on Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 5 / Sonnet 4.6, 2048 on Opus 4.7, and 4096 on Opus 4.6 /
// Opus 4.5 / Haiku 4.5 (Gemini 2.5 Flash implicit caching needs 2048). A prompt below a model's
// floor is not rejected - it silently produces cache_creation_input_tokens: 0, which is
// indistinguishable from the bug this suite hunts. Segments are therefore sized against the
// WORST floor in the matrix (4096), not the target model's, which is why {{cachePrefix}} (~5.9K
// tokens) is used whole and never sliced. Four segments puts each cell near 24K tokens.
//
// COST/CONCURRENCY: run this folder with PARALLEL=0. The harness forks one newman per provider,
// and these rows match six of them (openai/anthropic/gemini/vertex/bedrock/azure), so a default
// parallel run would execute every request up to six times over.

import { createHash } from "node:crypto";

// Hit-rate floor for EXPLICIT-breakpoint cells only. A warm byte-identical repeat reads

// it. Deliberately NOT applied to implicit-caching cells - see the header.
const HIT_RATE_FLOOR = 0.85;

// spend the whole cap thinking about a one-word answer and return finish_reason "length" with
// content:"" - which reads as a caching failure when the cache actually worked (those rounds
// reported cached_tokens 16512). Give just those cells enough headroom to emit the ack after
// reasoning. Kept per-cell rather than raising MAX_TOKENS globally so the other ~30 cells x 2 arms

//
// The Claude entry is the same failure in the adaptive-thinking family. Sonnet 5 rejects
// thinking:{type:"enabled"} with a 400 and is adaptive-only, so it thinks by default and there is
// no budget_tokens knob to turn it down with
// (https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking). At 256 it spends the
// entire cap thinking about a one-word answer and the turn ends mid-thinking, which returns
// stop_reason "max_tokens" with content:[] - reproduced directly against Bedrock:
//
//   max_tokens 64  -> stop_reason max_tokens, content [], output_tokens 64
//   unconstrained  -> content ["thinking", "text"]
//
// That empty content array reads as a caching failure when the cache actually worked (the failing
