// Verdict for run-stream-cancellation.mjs's non-streaming abort trials (#6972).
//
// Split out of the runner so it can be unit tested: the runner has top-level
// side effects (arg parsing, the case loop, process.exit) and cannot be imported
// from a test.
//
// The worker hands a finished non-streaming result (or error) to the caller
// through a cap-1 channel that is drained on acquire. When the caller has
// already gone, that send and ctx.Done() are both ready and Go picks between
// them at random, so the terminal post-hooks (billing, the log row's final
// status) ran for about half of the abandoned requests. The logging plugin
// inserts the row as `processing` at pre-hook; only the terminal hook moves it
// on. So the invariant is: every abandoned request's row exists AND carries a
// terminal status. Cost presence is not part of the invariant: once the
// transport cancels the context on a client socket close (#7106) the upstream
// call is cut with a 499 and usually has no usage.
//
// The same stuck-in-processing signature also covers #7308: after the claim
// handoff was added for #6972, the worker's claimed send kept a ctx.Done() arm,
// so it could still discard the value the caller was committed to receiving.
// The caller then parks forever in tryRequest's inner receive, its terminal
// hooks never run, and the row never leaves `processing`.
