# Prompt Caching Test Data
PROMPT_CACHING_LARGE_CONTEXT = """You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing legal documents. 
Here is a detailed legal framework for contract analysis:

1. CONTRACT FORMATION: A contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. The offer must be 
definite and communicated to the offeree. Acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer (mirror image 
rule). Consideration is the bargained-for exchange that makes the contract legally binding. Both parties 
must have the legal capacity to enter into a contract, and the contract's purpose must be legal.

2. WARRANTIES: Express warranties are explicit promises made by the seller about the product or service. 
Implied warranties include the warranty of merchantability (the product is fit for ordinary purposes) and 
the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (the product is suitable for a specific buyer's needs). 
These warranties provide guarantees about product or service quality and can be the basis for breach of 
contract claims.

3. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY: These clauses limit the amount or types of damages that can be recovered in 
case of breach. They may cap damages at a specific amount, exclude certain types of damages (like 
consequential or punitive damages), or limit liability to repair or replacement of defective goods. Courts 
scrutinize these clauses carefully and may refuse to enforce them if they are unconscionable or against 
public policy.

4. INDEMNIFICATION: Indemnification clauses require one party to compensate the other for losses, damages, 
or liabilities arising from specified events or claims. These provisions allocate risk between parties and 
are particularly important in contracts involving potential third-party claims. The scope of indemnification 
can vary widely, from narrow protection for specific claims to broad coverage for any losses arising from 
the relationship.

5. TERMINATION: Contract termination provisions specify the conditions under which either party may end the 
contractual relationship. These may include termination for cause (breach of contract), termination for 
convenience (with or without notice), automatic termination upon certain events, or mutual agreement. 
Termination clauses often address notice requirements, cure periods, and the parties' rights and obligations 
upon termination.

6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION: These provisions establish the methods for resolving disagreements between parties. 
Options include litigation in courts, arbitration (binding resolution by a neutral arbitrator), mediation 
(facilitated negotiation), or a combination of methods. Arbitration clauses often specify the arbitration 
rules (such as AAA or JAMS), the number of arbitrators, the location of arbitration, and whether arbitration 
decisions are binding and final.

7. FORCE MAJEURE: Force majeure clauses excuse performance when extraordinary events or circumstances beyond 
the parties' control prevent fulfillment of contractual obligations. These events typically include natural 
disasters, wars, pandemics, government actions, and other unforeseeable circumstances. The clause usually 
defines what constitutes a force majeure event and specifies the parties' obligations during such events, 
including notice requirements and efforts to mitigate damages.

8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: These provisions address rights related to patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade 
secrets, and other intellectual property. They may cover ownership of pre-existing IP, IP created during the 
contract term, licensing arrangements, and protection of proprietary information. IP clauses are crucial in 
technology, creative works, and research and development contracts.

9. CONFIDENTIALITY: Confidentiality provisions (also called non-disclosure clauses) impose obligations to 
protect sensitive information shared between parties. They define what constitutes confidential information, 
specify how it must be protected, limit its disclosure and use, and establish the duration of confidentiality 
obligations. These clauses often survive contract termination and may include exceptions for information that 
is publicly available or independently developed.

10. GOVERNING LAW: Governing law clauses specify which jurisdiction's laws will apply to interpret and enforce 
the contract. This is particularly important in contracts between parties in different states or countries. 
The chosen jurisdiction's laws will govern issues like contract formation, performance, breach, and remedies. 
These clauses often work in conjunction with venue or forum selection clauses that specify where disputes must 
be resolved.""" * 3  # Repeat to ensure sufficient tokens (1024+ minimum)
